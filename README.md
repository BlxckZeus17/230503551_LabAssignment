The project demonstrates building and deploying a simple website with both **static** and **dynamic** components.

🌐 **Pages**

   - Main homepage with my profile and career interests.  
   - Links to the project page and external profiles.

2. **project.html**

     - Name of the project  
     - Overview  
     - Objectives  
     - Team Members  
     - Technologies  

3. **dynamic.php**  
   - A PHP page that dynamically displays the current server date and time.  
   - Must be run on a PHP-enabled server (e.g., XAMPP, 000WebHost).  

4. **dynamic.jsp**

   - Must be run on an Apache Tomcat server.  

 🚀 **Deployment**
- Static pages (`230503551.html`, `project.html`) can be deployed to GitHub Pages.  
- Dynamic pages (`dynamic.php`, `dynamic.jsp`) require local or external servers:  
  - PHP → XAMPP or 000WebHost
